# Problem 1 : Discounts

We need you to build us a small (micro)service that calculates discounts for orders.

## How discounts work

For now, there are three possible ways of getting a discount:

- A customer who has already bought for over â‚¬ 1000, gets a discount of 10% on the whole order.
- For every product of category "Switches" (id 2), when you buy five, you get a sixth for free.
- If you buy two or more products of category "Tools" (id 1), you get a 20% discount on the cheapest product.

By the way: there may become more ways of granting customers discounts in the future.

## APIs

In the [example-orders](./example-orders/) directory, you can find a couple of example orders.
We would like to send them to your service in this form.
How the discounts are returned, is up to you. But make sure the reasons for the discounts are transparent.

In the [data](./data/) directory, you can find source files for customer data and product data.
You can assume these are in the format of the real external API.

## Guidelines

You are free to use any framework and packages that you like.

Teamleader is quite a big application, with many developers working on the code at the same time. It is no surprise that because of this, maintainability is one of the core values of the engineering team. Keep this in mind while working on your solution.
